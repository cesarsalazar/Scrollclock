The minimalist clock is also achieved with DOM elements and CSS. \r\n\r\nI made this for a website I'm designing where I want a fixed clock that is changing depending on the event shown in the viewport. The content I'm displaying is a schedule.\r\n\r\nI guess you can imagine other uses. Just tweak the code.","tagline":"The Scrollbar is the Time","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
